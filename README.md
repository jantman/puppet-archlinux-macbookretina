archlinux_macbookretina puppet module
=====================================

[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

Puppet module and accompanying documentation to install/setup Arch linux on a MacBook Pro Retina using puppet4.

This is the puppet module I use to manage my shiny new MacBook Pro Retina (mine is a ``MacBookPro11,4``).

__Important Notice:__ It is _highly_ recommended that you only run this module on a brand new system;
it makes some opinionated choices that may cause problems on existing systems.

Requirements
------------

* A MacBook Pro Retina (currently tested with Mid-2015 "11,4" model) with a __brand new install__ of Arch Linux
* Puppet4
* A minimal install, ideally following the instructions in my [workstation-bootstrap](https://github.com/jantman/workstation-bootstrap#arch-linux) repository.
* This module is only tested alongside my [archlinux_workstation](https://github.com/jantman/puppet-archlinux-workstation) module.
* A pacman repo providing ``xf86-input-mtrack-git``; you can use [jantman/archlinux_workstation archlinux_workstation::repos::jantman](https://github.com/jantman/puppet-archlinux-workstation/blob/master/manifests/repos/jantman.pp) for that.

Hardware Support Status
------------------------

### Mid-2015 MacBookPro11,4

#### Working

Or mostly-working:

* __Networking__
  * USB ethernet adapter A1277 works out-of-the-box
  * BCM43602 AirPort Extreme (14e4:43ba) works with kernel built-in [brcmfmac](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/brcm80211) driver, autodetected, but __2.4GHz only__
* __Sound__ - Works. Under KDE/Phonon, needed to unmute/enable the "Built-in Audio Analog Stereo" (detected "Built-in Audio Digital Stereo (HDMI)" as default).
* __Video__ - video works with the proprietary nvidia driver, the default in this module.
  * __External Displays__ - Tested OK using both direct HDMI and Thunderbolt to HDMI; works seamlessly.
  * __Display/Desktop Scaling__ - This can be fixed within KDE:
    * System Settings -> Fonts: check off "Force fonts DIP" and set to 144
    * System Settings -> Icons -> "Advanced" tab: set them all to 48
    * Click the menu button on the far right edge of the Panel, then drag the "Height" box up until the scale/size looks good
  * __Screen Backlight Adjustment__ - works using ``/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness`` or the sliders on 'KDE5 System Settings -> Energy Saving'
* __Hibernate / Suspend to Disk__ - doesn't wake up without long hold of power button & then turn back on. Session resumes once that's done.
* __SD Card Reader__ - Working out of the box.
* __Fans__ - macfanctld

#### Broken

* __Touchpad__ - Per the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Early_2015_13.22.2F15.22_-_Version_12.2Cx.2F11.2C4.2B), the touchpad isn't supported until kernel 4.2.x, with ``xf86-input-synaptics``. Until then, cursor and click works, but no right-click or scroll. I tried both [xf86-input-multitouch-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xf86-input-multitouch-git/) and [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics) and neither helped this. I was able to come up with a workaround to enable Command-click as right click per [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Ctrl-Click_as_Right-Click):
  1. ``pacman -S xbindkeys xdotool``
  2. Create ``~/.xbindkeysrc`` with the following two lines:
  ```
  "sleep .1 && xdotool click 3"
    Mod4 + Super_L + b:1
  ```
  3. ``echo 'xbindkeys' >> ~/.xprofile`` to start xbindkeys with your login session
  4. It's a bit finnicky - it doesn't work right every time - but this should let you use the left Command (Apple) key in combination with a mouse click to generate a right click.
* __Webcam__ - Per [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Web_cam), there's no driver for this yet. There's a [project on GitHub](https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie/) but it (2015-09-18) isn't working yet.
* __Suspend to RAM__ - doesn't wake up; long hold of power button & then turn back on gives a fresh boot.
* __Lid Close__ - suspends to ram and doesn't wake up
* __Bluetooth__ - Per [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Bluetooth_2), "not working at all"; even though ``dmesg`` shows that the bluetooth controller is recognized, my tests seem to confirm that it doesn't work.

#### Untested / To Do

* __Partially-complete__ - __SSD optimizations__ via sysctl settings, mount /dev/sda* noatime and discard (TRIM), use deadline scheduler on non-rotational disks
* __Keyboard Backlight__ - works via ``/sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness`` or the sliders on 'KDE5 System Settings -> Energy Saving'; https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Keyboard_backlight
* __Power Saving__ - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Powersave and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop_Mode_Tools
* __Ctrl-Click as Right Click__ - http://superuser.com/questions/217615/how-to-right-click-using-the-keyboard-from-ubuntu-on-a-mac
* __Hotkeys__ - [pommed-light](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pommed-light/) didn't work for me with the stock config. There's also patched [pommed-jalaziz](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pommed-jalaziz/) in AUR, from [github](https://github.com/jalaziz/pommed) but the support list only goes up to mid-2013 series. [this](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1550990#p1550990) indicates that the 4.2.x kernels should have touchpad *and* keyboard hotkeys working. Another option would be doing keybinding as described [here](http://nocodenolife.com/blog/2015/03/12/running-arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-retina-mid-2014/) or [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Apple_Macbook_Pro_Retina#Media_keys)
* [Laptop Mode Tools - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop_Mode_Tools) and/or  [TLP - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP) *(started looking into this, very involved configuration and I don't really need it right now)*
* I'm left handed. Use udev/xorg to reverse buttons on USB mice but keep trackpad the same. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/All_Mouse_Buttons_Working http://www.smop.co.uk/blog/index.php/2010/02/15/udev-rules-for-logitech-g7-mouse/ or might be able to do this with udev triggering "xinput set-button-map"
* the stuff in [Maximizing Performance - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Maximizing_Performance)
* implement the stuff in [Enhancing Arch Linux Stability - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Enhancing_Arch_Linux_Stability)
* SMART/other SSD health check, with warnings if things go south
* look into replacing macfanctld with mbpfan / fan-control-daemon are two options that are less abrupt

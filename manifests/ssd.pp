# Class: archlinux_macbookretina::ssd
#
# Sets up SSD-specific tuning on the system, disks and ext4 partitions
#
# Parameters:
#
# Actions:
#   - make sure /dev/sda* is mounted with noatime, not relatime
#   - make sure /dev/sda* ext4 partitions are mounted with discard for TRIM
#   - set deadline scheduler on non-rotational disks via udev rule
#   - set sysctl vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs to 1500; slow down vm dirty page writes to disk
#   - set sysctl vm.laptop_mode to 5; dont really understand applicability for SSDs, but suggested by Arch docs
#   - set sysctl vm.swappiness to 1; decrease swapping to disk as much as possible
#   - set sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure to 50; kernel prefers to retain dir/inode caches longer, reduces reads
#
# Requires:
#   - duritong/sysctl puppet forge module for sysctl::value type
#
# Sample Usage:
#
class archlinux_macbookretina::ssd {

  # this is a horrible hack, but I just can't find a better way to do it.
  # augeas' XPath queries don't handle globbing or regexes the way I want.
  # so we have to use a custom fact to find the mounted /dev/sda partitions
  # then (since facter only returns strings) split it, and pass the array
  # to create the define for each partition
  # TODO: commented out until I have linux running on a machine to test this
  #$ssd_partitions = split($::partitions_sda, ',')

  # make sure relatime isn't specified on the /dev/sda mounts and noatime is
  # TODO: commented out until I have linux running on a machine to test this
  #fstab_replace_option {$ssd_partitions:
  #  old_option => 'relatime',
  #  option     => 'noatime',
  #}

  # since we're arch, we're going to assume you're on a recent kernel (at time of module writing)
  # TODO: commented out until I have linux running on a machine to test this
  #fstab_add_option {$ssd_partitions:
  #  option => 'discard',
  #  only_fstype => 'ext4',
  #}

  # CFQ is a *bad* scheduler for SSD. let's tell udev that we want to use deadline instead

## [0.3.1] Released 2019-03-19

This project is now officially unsupported/abandoned and looking for a new maintainer. Please see [Issue 16](https://github.com/jantman/puppet-archlinux-macbookretina/issues/16) for details and to comment.

## [0.3.0] Released 2018-02-03

This release makes major changes to the module code style, testing and deployment. It does not make any functional changes to what the module does or how it works.

- Switch to new-style typed parameters.
- Modernize module layout and testing.
- Update supported and tested Puppet versions to 4 and 5.
- Pin puppetlabs-stdlib dependency to 4.12.0, as this module still uses the deprecated ``validate_`` functions (and its archlinux_workstation dependency requires <= 4.12.0).
- Use puppet-strings for documentation
- Automate deployment through TravisCI
- Minor README and CONTRIBUTING documentation updates.
- Add automated ``github_release`` Rake task.
- Bump puppet-blacksmith gem version and configure for signed tags.
- Reformat changelog
- Add ``.sync.yml`` for my [modulesync_configs](https://github.com/jantman/modulesync_configs)
- Update ``.travis.yml``, ``Gemfile`` and some documentation via modulesync.
- Fix ``metadata.json`` casing of supported operatingsystem name.
